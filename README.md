**Summary of Requirements and Goals**

The inventory app was designed to help users efficiently manage and track their inventory items. The
primary user need it addressed was the ability to add, delete, and update items in real-time, ensuring
accurate and up-to-date stock information. The app aimed to simplify inventory management for
individuals or small businesses by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The app features a log-in screen, inventory screen, and a SMS enabling screen.
The UI was designed with users in mind, featuring a clean layout, intuitive icons, and clear navigation, making it both functional and visually appealing. This user-centered approach was successful because it prioritized simplicity and efficiency, allowing users to manage inventory without confusion.

I approached coding the app using agile development practices, breaking it into modules like inventory management and UI components.
Testing revealed bugs early, such as data validation issues, which I fixed to ensure the app was functional and met user needs. One challenge was scalability, which I addressed by optimizing database queries and implementing pagination for the inventory list. I was particularly successful in demonstrating my UI/UX design skills, creating an intuitive interface that balanced functionality and aesthetics. This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design, iterative development, and thorough testing, which I will carry forward into future app development endeavors.
